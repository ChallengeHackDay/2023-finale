The first step is to find the name of the building/monument in the image. 
With a reverse image search, it's easy to find that it's the arenes in Nimes, France.

We then use google map to find the position taken when the photograph was taken:
https://www.google.fr/maps/@43.8347568,4.3605882,3a,90y,294.28h,112.65t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipMDwZbRGUu1jSEZkBM_DVoewnZMS9F3QD5MpMQs!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMDwZbRGUu1jSEZkBM_DVoewnZMS9F3QD5MpMQs%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya19.776945-ro-0-fo100!7i4608!8i2304

It is then possible to find the time of the photo using the position of the sun. But you need to know the date. This can be obtained using the exiftool command, which retrieves information from the image.
